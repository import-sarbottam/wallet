## üî® Challenges we ran into

The main challenge for us was to create a backend server for storing our data and user authentication. As we are not acquainted with Node.js and MongoDB, so we opted to use Firebase as our backend server. But we ran into problems as some parts of the Firebase were not well documented. But ultimately Stack Overflow answers came to the rescue. Secondly searching for the APIs were a pain, as most of the APIs were either paid or had very low API call limit, so had to search a lot of websites to get some adequate APIs. But alas, we did not find an adequate API for stocks and so we decided to create a python script that will scrape BSE and NSE Top 10 Gainers from Financial Express every hour and push them to our Firebase Database as a python object(which is eventually converted to a JSON).
